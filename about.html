        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>A lifelong artist, I have worked with a bunch of different mediums from acrylics to charcoal to watercolor. 
        I'm always looking to try something new or master a different technqiue.</p>
        <p>Lately, I've become fascinated with Impressionism. I have always been into photorealism as an artist. I wanted 
        to really go outside my comfort zone. The works on this site are my forays into Impressionism.</p>
